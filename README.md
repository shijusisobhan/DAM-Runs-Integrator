# DAM_Runs_Integrator.R

DAM_Runs_Integrator.R is an R program designed to combine data from different behavioral experiments conducted using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) system. The main purposes of this program are:
1.	Combine Monitor Files: Merge different monitor files generated by the DAM system across various experiments (runs).
2.	Rename Monitor Files: Avoid conflicts by renaming monitor files if they share the same name in different runs.
3.	Combine Genotype Specification Files: Prepare a combined genotype specification file for analysis using SleepMat, a behavioral analysis software program for the DAM system.
These processes enable multiple run analyses using [SleepMat](https://github.com/shijusisobhan/SleepMat2022.1).
